## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn
*   A Firebase project set up with:
    *   **Firestore** enabled
    *   **Authentication** (Email/Password or other methods as needed)
    *   **Storage** (if image uploads are implemented for premium features)
*   A Google Cloud Project with the **Vertex AI API** enabled for Genkit AI features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/vyapar-sahayak.git
    cd vyapar-sahayak
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase project configuration details:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

    # For Genkit AI features
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key_for_vertex_ai
    ```
    *   Replace `your_...` with your actual Firebase and Google Cloud credentials.
    *   **Important for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: This key is used by Genkit to interact with Google AI models (like Gemini). Ensure it has access to the Vertex AI API.
    *   **Important for `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`**: Ensure this is the correct URL (e.g., `your-project-id.appspot.com`). Incorrect configuration here is a common source of "storage/unknown" errors.

### Running the Application

Vyapar Sahayak uses Next.js for the frontend and Genkit for AI flow development.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    This will run the main application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (optional, for AI feature development):**
    If you are working on or testing AI flows with Genkit, run this in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    # npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This usually starts the Genkit development UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

## üîë Key Functionality Deep Dive

### Product Management
Add, view, edit, and delete products in your inventory. Each product can have a name, category, price, quantity, and an optional minimum stock threshold. The system will alert you for low-stock items based on these thresholds.

### Billing (Multi-Lingual POS)
The billing interface allows for quick addition of products to a customer's cart. Search for products, adjust quantities, and see the total amount update in real-time. Customer details can be optionally added. The interface is available in English, Hinglish, and Hindi, making it accessible to a wider range of users.
